/*
    Write a program that reads a sequence of natural numbers and, for each one, tells
    if it is a prime number or not. Remember that a natural number is prime if and only if it
    is greater than 1 and it does not have any positive divisor other than 1 and itself.

    Input consists of a number n, followed by n natural numbers.

    For every given natural number, tell in a line if it is prime or not,
    following the format of the example.

    For every given n, at most about âˆšn  steps are needed to know if it is prime or not.
