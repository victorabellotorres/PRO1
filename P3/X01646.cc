/*
    Program that reads a basis for numeration and several numbers and prints the sum in base 10 of the digits in base b of each one.

    Input consists of the value of bâ‰¥ 2 followed by a sequence of natural numbers.

    For every number, print the sum (in base 10) of its digits in base b following the format of the examples: (base 10)
    29: 11
    7: 7
    0: 0
    1020: 3
